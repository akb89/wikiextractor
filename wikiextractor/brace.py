    # Parsing is done with respect to pairs of double braces {{..}} delimiting
    # a template, and pairs of triple braces {{{..}}} delimiting a tplarg.
    # If double opening braces are followed by triple closing braces or
    # conversely, this is taken as delimiting a template, with one left-over
    # brace outside it, taken as plain text. For any pattern of braces this
    # defines a set of templates and tplargs such that any two are either
    # separate or nested (not overlapping).

    # Unmatched double rectangular closing brackets can be in a template or
    # tplarg, but unmatched double rectangular opening brackets cannot.
    # Unmatched double or triple closing braces inside a pair of
    # double rectangular brackets are treated as plain text.
    # Other formulation: in ambiguity between template or tplarg on one hand,
    # and a link on the other hand, the structure with the rightmost opening
    # takes precedence, even if this is the opening of a link without any
    # closing, so not producing an actual link.

    # In the case of more than three opening braces the last three are assumed
    # to belong to a tplarg, unless there is no matching triple of closing
    # braces, in which case the last two opening braces are are assumed to
    # belong to a template.

    # We must skip individual { like in:
    #   {{#ifeq: {{padleft:|1|}} | { | | &nbsp;}}
    # We must resolve ambiguities like this:
    #   {{{{ }}}} -> { {{{ }}} }
    #   {{{{{ }}}}} -> {{ {{{ }}} }}
    #   {{#if:{{{{{#if:{{{nominee|}}}|nominee|candidate}}|}}}|...}}
